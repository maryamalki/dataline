## Overview
We use React + Typescript + Tailwindcss. For UI and design, we try to stick to TailwindUI components as much as possible, and HeroIcons for icons.

Rest should be self-explanatory!

## Installation
`npm install`


## Running
You should make sure the backend is running for this part (port 7377).

```
export NODE_ENV=local
npm run dev
```


## Tauri
Will come later. Not working perfectly yet, not a certain need either.
